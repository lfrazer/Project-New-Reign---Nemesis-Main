-Need to force include include/Global.h
-Which version of VS is this targetting? Many issues in VS2019
-Must target 32 bit due to Havok, essential to select x86(32bit) in CMake setup
-Tried to link with python38.lib but according to README requries python35.lib, manual fix in project
-Some files not included in CMake build causing linker errors? Had to manually include: writeextfile.cpp
